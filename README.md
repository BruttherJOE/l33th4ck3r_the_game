# l33th4ck3r_the_game
A game I made for digital world assignment.  
This game made to be able to be fully run on any python program that has a terminal.  
In time, I will make it into an executable (.exe)  
It does not require any downloads, installs, or external libraries.  
  
  ## Description
```
You are playing as a master hacker that students look up to.  
A student wants you to hack into the school network and change his DW grades.  
He promises you a great sum of money as compensation.  
  
To do that, you have to ddos the school network,  
then ssh into one of the prof's computer and change the student's grades.
```  
  
While not 100% factually correct, this game serves as a beginner tutorial on shell navigation in linux.  
Perhaps, in future, if time permits, I will add in more functions. Or you can pay me to complete the game.

## Disclaimer
I do not hold any liability or responsibility for any wannabe hackers that cause damage to property or infrastructure of any sort.
