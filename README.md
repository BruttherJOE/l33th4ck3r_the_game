  ## Introduction
A game I made for digital world assignment.  
This game was created for me to learn simple TUI (text-based user interface), as well as simple OOP and simple recursive functions.  
This game made to be able to be fully run on any python program that has a terminal.  
In time, I will make it into an executable (.exe)  
It does not require any downloads, installs, or external libraries. This was a constraint given to me for the purposes of this game, or else I would have used the curses library as it is a prebuilt library.  
  
  ## Description
```
You are playing as an elite hacker that even cs students look up to.  
A student wants you to hack into the school network and change his DW grades.  
He promises you a great sum of money as compensation.  
  
To do that, you have to ddos the school network,  
then ssh into one of the prof's computer and change the student's grades.
```  
  
  `This is an educational puzzle game intended for people new to linux shell navigation.`
  
While not 100% factually correct, this game serves as a beginner tutorial on shell navigation in linux.  
Perhaps, in future, if time permits, I will add in more functions, and levels will get progressively harder and more complicated. Or you can pay me to complete the game.
  
## Controls  
You are to type commands to navigate the command terminal.  
`cd`- change directory  
  `cd ~` to move to home directory  
  `cd desktop` to move to desktop directory  
`ls`- lists all available files  
  
  to open programs, `[programname].exe`  
  to exit programs, `z`  
  to read files, `nano [filename]`  or `sudo nano [filename]`. this includes the extension at the end.  
  an example is `nano readme.txt`  
  
  to ssh, `ssh [username]@[ip address]` in the home directory.  
  
  ## Navigation
  ALL information on what to type in the terminal can be found in the numerous help files and notes located in my virtual terminal in this game. the user is expected to find them and use them, to complete the game.
  

## Disclaimer
I do not hold any liability or responsibility for any wannabe hackers that cause damage to property or infrastructure of any sort.  
  
  Do not attempt to DDOS anyone. This is against the law in most states and it will be easy for you to be caught.  
  
  I do not endorse any form of cyber attack.
